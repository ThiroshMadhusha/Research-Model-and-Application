`Individual Research Question:`

**IT20146238 - Jayathunga T.M.**

The main problem of this research is the lack of a mobile phone-based Sinhala book reader with a Text-to-Speech(TTS) feature to remove the current barrier for Sri Lankans who are visually impaired individuals to access printed books. This platform would enable visually impaired individuals to easily access books and other text materials in Sinhala by converting the text into speech.

Understanding the restrictions that visually impaired person experience while using cell phones for Text-to-Speech(TTS) is crucial for finding solutions to this issue. One drawback is the absence of Text-to-Speech(TTS) features in cell phones designed exclusively for the Sinhala language. Many smartphones lack built-in TTS engines that can read Sinhala, making it difficult for those who are blind to read Sinhala text on their devices.

The caliber of the TTS output is an additional restriction. Sinhala is a complicated language, making it difficult to correctly translate text to speech without using specialist algorithms and linguistic models. It isn't easy to create a Sinhala TTS system that generates clear, high-quality addresses.
Several research topics might be taken into consideration in order to solve these restrictions and create a mobile-based Sinhala book reader with a Text-to-Speech(TTS) feature for visually impaired people:
1. What are the best models and algorithms for creating a Sinhala TTS system that generates understandable, natural speech?
2. How can the TTS system be improved to accommodate the various intonations, styles, and dialects of Sinhala speech?
3. What are the best methods for incorporating TTS capability for a smooth user experience into a mobile application?
4. How can the TTS system be made to respond to the preferences of each user, such as voice preference, speaking rate changes, and pronunciation adjustments?
5. What are the best ways to assess the quality and understandability of Sinhala TTS output?

The study would probably use machine learning methods, natural language processing, and Sinhala-specific voice synthesis algorithms to answer these research objectives. For testing and training the TTS system, a sizable collection of Sinhala text and related audio recordings would also be necessary.
The mobile-based Sinhala book reader with TTS capabilities might include other features to improve the user experience in addition to answering the research questions. These capabilities might include bookmarking, text highlighting that is timed to speech, navigational choices, and interaction with online booksellers or libraries.

Visually impaired individuals in Sri Lanka would have better access to Sinhala literature and educational resources if a thorough mobile-based Sinhala book reader with TTS capabilities were created. This would enable children to read books and other written material on their own, fostering their personal development, education, and general quality of life.

The main research problem is that most visually impaired people in Sri Lanka do not have access 
to a platform that enables them to capture the text they need and read it.
To address this problem, it is important to first understand the limitations that visually impaired 
people face when using smartphones. One major limitation is the lack of accessibility features that 
cater to their needs. For example, many smartphones do not have built-in screen readers or other 
assistive technologies that make it easier for visually impaired individuals to use the device. 
Additionally, some visually impaired individuals may have limited knowledge about how to use 
these technologies and may require additional training and support to take full advantage of them.
Another limitation that visually impaired individuals face is the quality of digital images captured 
by smartphone cameras. In order for OCR technology to work effectively, the text needs to be 
captured in high resolution and with proper lighting. Many smartphones do not have cameras that 
are suitable for capturing high-quality images, which can make it difficult for visually impaired 
individuals to use OCR apps to capture and read text.
By exploring these limitations and identifying potential solutions, it may be possible to develop a 
platform that meets the needs of visually impaired individuals in Sri Lanka, enabling them to 
capture and read the text they need using their smartphones. This could have a significant impact 
on the quality of life of visually impaired individuals by providing them with greater access to 
information and opportunities for personal growth and development.
As another problem I have identified is related to the development of an Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) system that can accurately identify Sinhala characters and form words 
using an engine, and then translate the text to speech. This is a challenging problem because 
Sinhala is a complex language with a unique set of characters that require specialized 
algorithms for recognition and word formation.
Some of the specific research questions that could be addressed in this project include:
1. What are the most effective algorithms for accurately identifying Sinhala characters 
using OCR technology?
2. How can these algorithms be optimized for different fonts, styles, and sizes of 
Sinhala text?
3. What are the best techniques for combining identified characters into words using an 
engine?
4. How can the system be trained to recognize Sinhala words in different contexts and 
accurately translate them to speech?
5. What are the most effective approaches for integrating the OCR, word formation, and 
text-to-speech technologies into a cohesive system?

To address these research questions, the project would likely involve a combination of 
machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision techniques. It would 
also require a large dataset of Sinhala text and audio recordings for training and testing the 
system. The end result would be a valuable tool for people who are visually impaired or have 
difficulty reading Sinhala text.

Blind people face several challenges when reading books, but the main problem is a lack of accessibility to printed materials. Despite advancements in assistive technology, such as text-to-speech software and Braille displays, most books are still not accessible to blind individuals in an easily readable format. This can limit the opportunities for blind people to gain knowledge, engage in literary experiences, and improve their education and employment prospects.
One issue is the cost of specialized devices and software, which can be prohibitively expensive for many blind people. Even when these tools are available, they may not provide an experience that is comparable to reading a traditional printed book. For example, text-to-speech software can struggle with complex language and formatting, and Braille displays can be slow and clunky.

Another issue is the limited availability of audiobooks and Braille materials. While more audiobooks are being produced, the selection is still limited compared to the vast number of printed books. Braille books are even harder to come by, as the process of translating printed books into Braille is time-consuming and costly. This means that blind people may not have access to the latest best-selling books or popular educational materials.

Recognizing the limitations visually impaired individuals encounter while using mobile phones, particularly the absence of Sinhala voice navigation and feedback guide features, is essential for devising effective solutions. Many smartphones lack built-in capabilities to provide voice-based navigation and feedback in the Sinhala language, making it challenging for the blind to access Sinhala text on their devices.

Another crucial aspect to consider is the quality of the voice navigation and feedback system. Sinhala is a complex language, requiring specialized algorithms and linguistic models to accurately translate text into speech. Developing a Sinhala voice navigation and feedback system that delivers clear and high-quality output poses a significant challenge.

To address these limitations and cater to the needs of visually impaired individuals in Sri Lanka, several research topics can be explored:
1. Identifying optimal models and algorithms for developing a Sinhala voice navigation and feedback system that provides intelligible and natural speech.
2. Enhancing the voice navigation and feedback system to accommodate the diverse intonations, styles, and dialects of Sinhala speech.
3. Implementing effective methods to integrate voice navigation and feedback capabilities seamlessly into a mobile application for a user-friendly experience.
4. Personalizing the voice navigation and feedback system to cater to individual user preferences, such as voice selection, adjustable speaking rates, and pronunciation adjustments.
5. Establishing reliable methods for assessing the quality and comprehensibility of Sinhala voice navigation and feedback output.

In conclusion, the main problem that blind people face in reading books is a lack of accessibility to printed materials. Despite advances in assistive technology, there are still significant barriers to overcome, such as the cost of specialized devices and software, the limited availability of audiobooks materials, and the difficulty in providing a comparable reading experience to that of a traditional printed book in Sinhala. To address these challenges, there needs to be a concerted effort to make books more accessible to blind people and to ensure they have the same opportunities to engage with literature and gain knowledge as sighted individuals.
